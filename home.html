                <h2>The Work We Do</h2>
                <p>ClaySys, as a technology consulting service provider, specializes in delivering IT solutions that
                    make a positive impact on businesses. Our focus is not only on a successful technical
                    implementation, but we are mindful of the business impact all through the project, to ensure we
                    mould and tune the implementation to stay aligned with the key business objectives at all times. We
                    work with a wide portfolio of technologies and products, to enable us to deliver real value to our
                    customers and to provide consulting services to our customers with their existing investments in
                    their technology platforms. If you have a defined requirement, our technology consultants would be
                    able to plan, design and develop your custom solution, in most cases based on a fixed price
                    engagement. The ability to engage on a fixed price basis is dependent on the client's solution
                    requirements being defined in enough detail. We also have an option to support a client to initially
                    create and finalize the requirements and design, at which point we could transition to a fixed price
                    engagement for the development and final deliverable phase.</p>
                <h2>Why We Are Different</h2>
                <p>
                    ClaySys has always focused on a partnership model and building long term relationships with our
                    clients. So our focus is always the best interests of our clients, versus just a specific technology
                    project. We believe in retaining key employees, as that ensures continuity of quality support to our
                    clients, without the disruption associated with a constant churn and attrition with employees. Since
                    we are a software product company as well, we try to adhere to the highest standards in terms of
                    technology architecture, patterns, security practices, and solution scalability and maintainability.
